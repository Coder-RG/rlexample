# RLexample

This is a simple example of reinforcement learning. Hope this encourages you
to build something interesting yourself.

## Environment

![Environment](images/env1.png)

## Test yourself!

All the available code is in SliderReward[1-3].py files. Each file
contains complete and independant code.

To run any of the files:
```bash
python3 SliderReward[1-3].py <no-of-episodes>
```
Here `<no-of-episodes>` is the amount of  iterations for training
the agent.

**Example**
```bash
$ python SliderReward1.py

$ python3 SliderReward1.py 100
```
